## 👋 Hi, I’m Sven Michels

- 👨‍💻 I’m on my way to becoming a full-stack developer — currently focusing on Angular, TypeScript & clean code architecture
- 💡 I love building things from scratch and bringing ideas to life – one pixel and byte at a time
- 🌱 I’m currently diving deeper into Angular and planning to revisit React next
- 🔧 Skilled in: HTML • CSS • JavaScript • TypeScript • Angular • Git • Firebase • REST APIs • Scrum basics
- 🛠 I also enjoy designing modular UI components and architecting scalable web apps
- 🧩 Founder of **[PixelByte.Dev](https://github.com/PixelByte-Dev)** – a collaborative platform for learning, creating and sharing awesome dev projects (like a pixel-perfect Kanban board or an AI-enhanced task planner)
- 🤝 Looking to collaborate with other devs, creatives, and curious minds
- 📫 Reach me anytime at: Sven.Michels@hotmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him (or just "Code Whisperer")
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once debugged a bug before coffee... never again. Also: **Never stop Learing** – on purpose 😄
